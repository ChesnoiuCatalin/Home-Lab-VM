# Home-Lab-VM

A home lab for ethical hacking can be set up using a virtual machine (VM) such as VirtualBox. The lab can be used to simulate a real-world environment, allowing users to practice their ethical hacking skills in a safe and secure environment. Here is how a basic home lab for ethical hacking can be set up using VirtualBox:

1. Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox.

Oracle VM Virtual Box : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Create two virtual machines, one for the attacker and one for the target.

3. Install the same operating system on both machines, such as Windows or Linux.

4. Set up the networking for both machines to allow for communication between the two.

5. Install the necessary tools for ethical hacking on the attacker machine.

6. Install vulnerable software or services on the target machine, such as FTP or web servers.

7. Begin testing your ethical hacking skills on the target machine.

8. Monitor the target machine for any suspicious activity or suspicious connections.

9. Document the results of your tests and any findings.

10. Use the results of your tests to improve your ethical hacking skills.
