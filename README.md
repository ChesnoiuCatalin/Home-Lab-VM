# Home-Lab-VM

A home lab for ethical hacking can be set up using a virtual machine (VM) such as VirtualBox. The lab can be used to simulate a real-world environment, allowing users to practice their ethical hacking skills in a safe and secure environment. Here is how a basic home lab for ethical hacking can be set up using VirtualBox:

1. Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox.

Oracle VM Virtual Box : https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Create two virtual machines, one for the attacker and one for the target.

3. Install the same operating system on both machines, such as Windows or Linux.

4. Set up the networking for both machines to allow for communication between the two.

5. Install the necessary tools for ethical hacking on the attacker machine.

6. Install vulnerable software or services on the target machine, such as FTP or web servers.

7. Begin testing your ethical hacking skills on the target machine.

8. Monitor the target machine for any suspicious activity or suspicious connections.

9. Document the results of your tests and any findings.

10. Use the results of your tests to improve your ethical hacking skills.



# The advantages of using a local Home Lab are :

1. Cost-Effective: One of the main benefits of using a local VM home lab for ethical hacking is its cost-effectiveness. It is much cheaper to set up and maintain a home lab than to purchase and maintain expensive hardware and software.

2. Flexibility: With a home lab, a hacker can easily customize the environment to their exact needs. This makes it much easier to learn different techniques and develop new skills.

3. Security: By keeping the lab local, the hacker can keep their data and activities secure from outside intrusions and vulnerabilities.

4. Accessibility: A local VM home lab can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making it ideal for those who travel or work from home.

5. Scalability: The lab can easily be expanded as needed to accommodate more machines or other components. This allows for the flexibility to experiment with different techniques and technologies.

# Wath I learn in the process

Knowledgeable about OSINT best practices and protocols, such as the use of privacy settings, data protection, and online forensics. I use tools like : Maltego, Shodan, Google Dorks, TheHarvester, OpenVAS

Ability to analyze and interpret network traffic using packet sniffers, such as Wireshark.

Ability to quickly identify open ports and services using tools such as nmap, Nessus, and other port scanners.

Network scanning using tools such as NMAP and Nessus can help identify potential vulnerabilities in a system. Once identified, these vulnerabilities can be patched or addressed to protect the system from potential security threats.

Knowledgeable in Active Directory, group policies, and network protocols. I am using Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 machines to learn more about Active Directory, how to administer a local network, and how to use this knowledge in a penetration test as an "attacker".
